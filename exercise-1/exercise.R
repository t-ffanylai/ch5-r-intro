# Exercise 1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "Seattle"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Tiffany"

# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- 62

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 2

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs
puppy.price = 1000

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost = 2000

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater # than $1,000
too.expensive = TRUE

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford # for $1,000
max.puppies = 1
